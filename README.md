#### JQuery:

JQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, handle events, and develop applications. JQuery has a large library built upon JavaScript. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications. For example rather the creating element by element, assigning attributes to each, as you would with JavaScript. JQuery allows direct HTML code to be pasted into the `script` file using 'back-ticks'. JQuery also allows 'template-string' that dynamically changes each iteration of a repeated code using a simple 'string'.
